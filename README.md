# Methylation in 28S in Drosophila melanogaster

RNA dot blot identified a potential locus of a methylated cytosine in 28S which increases its methylation in disease conditionsa and decreases under disease suppressor. A bisulfite sequencing was carried out to confirm the potential site, 3402 in 28S sequence `pdb|3J3E|5`. This repository contains the code used to analyse sequencing data.
