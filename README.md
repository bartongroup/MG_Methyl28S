# Methylation in 28S in Drosophila melanogaster

RNA dot blot identified a potential locus of a methylated cytosine in 28S which increases its methylation in disease conditionsa and decreases under disease suppressor. A bisulfite sequencing was carried out to confirm the potential site, 3402 in 28S sequence [pdb|3J3E|5](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nucleotide/3J3E_5). This repository contains the code used to analyse sequencing data.
